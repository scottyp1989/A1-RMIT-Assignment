										<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
										<blockquote><p>Traits: Introverted &ndash; 62%, Observant &ndash; 60%, Feeling &ndash; 52%, Judging &ndash; 58%, Turbulent &ndash; 71%</p>
<p>Role: Sentinel &ndash; Strategy: Constant Improvement</p>
<h4>Brief description of Type:</h4>
<p>In their unassuming, understated way, Defenders help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. Defenders can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.</p>

									<h3>Learning Style test</h3>
									<blockquote><p>Results: Kinesthetics learner</p>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>If you are a kinesthetics learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.</p></blockquote>

											<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
											<p>While mildly insightful. In my opinion most of these tests are more akin to astrology than science. In astrology it often 12 different ways of essentially saying the same thing and I don&rsquo;t think these results are much different.</p>
											<p>In that saying that I did identify with various elements of some of the results. I also saw a lot in there that I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with. For example. In the Myers Briggs result said ISFJ-T people don&rsquo;t like to cut corners in the work environment that is just plain wrong half my career has been finding effective and meaningful way to cut corners, it not about being lazy or not putting in the effort I am certainly not afraid of hard work, but I am a big believer in working smart not hard.</p>

											<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
											<p>To be honest at best I think it will cause everyone including myself to reflect on what they think their traits are verse what the tests “revealed” about themselves. Which may drive changes within themselves so they can fit the version of how they perceive themselves and how they want to be seen in the team. Ultimately the rest are limited, and I am hopeful everyone will take them with a grain of salt. </p>

										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
											<p>I won&rsquo;t. The only value these tests have are the possible self-reflection that may cause in the individual. I do not think they be considered when forming a team, but I think they may be insightful once a team is formed. The team can discuss how they feel about their own results what if anything they felt about accuracy of it, if it will drive any changes or observation in themselves.</p>
											<p>At the end of the day people have layers, people are not defined by one element of themselves (or one test). These tests do not allow for the level of complexity that is every single human being. Not in a schizophrenic way but each of us have multiple version and personalities based on a lot of variables, such as mood, hormones, our energy levels, how confident or not we&rsquo;re feeling at any given moment, the amount of sleep we get. Depending on those variables I can be two completely different versions of myself. A confident individual who can embrace a leader role in a team setting or I can be a self-conscious follower all too eager to sit back and play a supporting role.</p>
