													<h3>Plan to obtain the required skills, qualifications, and experience to get the job</h3>
													<p>For starters I would start by increasing my relevant tertiary qualification by studying a Bachelor of Information Technology or more ideally a Bachelor of Information Systems (not the same thing at some universities). I would explore the possibilities of doing courses that specifically dealt with project management hopefully covering methodologies such as Prince2/PMbok). I would also continue to work on new projects at my current role as there are several on the horizon. This would give me more project exposure.</p>
													<p>My current career path is presently heading toward more of a system/business analyst role and initially I think I would continue down that role.&nbsp; Learning how to bridge the gap between technology and business I think would be instrument in ultimately managing a large complex project. Once I get my degree, I would try to get a job at a bigger company that had more complex needs than my current employer. Hopefully in a business analyst role that would see me hopefully be a part of and lead various ICT projects. I&rsquo;d then leverage that skills and experience into a Full-time project manager role with a continue focus on ICT based projects. Continuing working my and undertaking larger and more complex projects until I had the experience needed to apply for such a role.</p>
													<p>Once I was on the business analyst/Project management path I would continually look for ways to strength my relevant skills, perhaps joining organization say as the international institute of business analysis. Expanding my skills and experience out to various project methodologies such as Agile, lean, Kanban to name a few.&nbsp;</p>
