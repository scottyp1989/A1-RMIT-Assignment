										<h3>About me</h3>
										<p>Born 1989 in Sydney, Australia.  I was released onto this world alongside The Simpsons, Lethal weapon 2 and the release of Gameboy in Japan and North America. I have lived in Sydney my entire life, predominately in the outer Western Suburbs of Sydney in a region called the Hawkesbury. Other than my father unfortunately dying when I was 7. I would say I’ve had a very typical lower middle-class childhood. Back when I was a kid, we didn’t have much in the way of IT as except for my brother and a couple of cousins it would not be entirely unreasonable to call my family “technophobes” suffice to say they’ve been slow to adapt to the times (my mother still doesn’t have Facebook, how great is that). As an adult I work in IT and well now I study IT as-well, but we’ll get back to that later in the assessment. Outside of work and study, I live a rather simple and peaceful life especially post covid. Like many I have a range of hobbies and interests the most notable, well at-least the most interesting to me would be Sci-fi. I love all thing Sci-Fi’s I love, games, movies, shows whatever. I think it fairer to say I love all thing space in general. If I was about 10 times smarter, I might have tried becoming an Astrophysicist. On clear nights I love looking up at the night sky and just looking at the star imagining the possibilities. I think that why I love IT as-well. What draws me to theses interests so much is the vastness of them, the unknown, the possibilities. I believe in a brighter future for humanity, and I believe to get to that brighter future, we need to look to technology, and we need to look to space. </p>
