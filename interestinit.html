									<h2>Interests in IT</h2>

										<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
										<p>I have a diverse interest in IT across many areas but some of them include IOT, Data analytics, BI and project management. In general, I love learning how to solve problems with technology and how to use technology to solve problems. IT is heavily integrated into my life. Example I have a smart device in every room. If I am awake, I am probably using or near some form of technology. It not just integrated in my personal life but my professional life too. I work in IT.  One thing that really interest me in IT is the possibilities and the innovation that comes with it. 30 years ago, they never would have thought it been possible that we do the things we are doing with AI right now. Now AI is starting to pop up everywhere, from self-driving cars to our own personal assistants like Alexa. </p>
										<p>I think what interests me most about IT though in a practical sense is that I love helping people. IT allows me to do not just personally but professionally.  I am the default go to IT support for all my friend and family. I have helped mum and her husband business start and grow in way I never would been able to if I wasn’t interested in IT.  Professionally have I not only helped many end users and stop them from pulling their hair out, but I have also help companies on a whole save money, protect their data and be make them more productive. IT doesn’t just allow me to help it also allows me to connect with those I help in ways I never would be able to if I didn’t have an interest in IT. </p>

										<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
										<p>I’ve had an interest in IT since my first video game which would have been something on the Atari. I think my interest in IT as a hobby started when I was about 12 and my mum brought home our first computer. My brother would use it for hours often appearing so entertained even when he wasn’t playing games. It intrigued me unfortunately, my brother wasn’t too forthcoming regarding how to do anything he was doing on the computer (he wanted the computer to himself). So, I had to teach myself to use it for anything. To install the games I wanted to play, to find interesting things to look up on the internet, discussion forums, chatrooms etc. With every step of teaching myself there was a new problem or hurdle to overcome which furthered my interest. I remember one time excitedly brought a PC game (Red Faction) with my hard-earned pocket money, nagging my mum for us to leave the shops as soon as I brought it so I could go home and install it and play it.  Only when I got home, it wouldn’t work. I spent hours trying and trying so many different things until I discovered that software and games have minimum requirements for graphics and our PC graphic card didn’t meet it. Despite the disappointment that led to me eventually building my first gaming PC on a budget, which meant I had to work out what components I needed, what worked with what, how to put it all together, then installing the operation system, installing drivers, etc. The first thing I did when I had finished building the PC was to install that game I brought. Unfortunately it still didn’t work, from memory I believe it was related to driver compatibility issue between graphic card and the game. </p>
										<p>At times I think the universe is telling me something as I run into a lot of problems when using technology but no matter what issues, I am always driven to find the solution because from my perspective IT will always be two sides of the same coin, a problem and a solution and the solution is often worth challenging the problem.By the way for those reading if curious. I did finally play that game, I think close to 10 years later installed using the same cd I brought all those years ago.  It was a really rewarding feeling for about an hour then I realized I didn’t like that game and probably wouldn’t have even back then. You win some, you lose some. </p>

										<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
										<p>I think what sparked my interest in IT at-least professionally was my computer teach Colin in TAFE. Before I had an interest in pursuing IT as a career. I had always wanted to be a lawyer, studying corporate law most likely. It was Colin who saw my passion and aptitude for IT. In his class I already knew everything he was teaching the others, If I didn’t, I’d quickly learn. He even was nice enough to find harder stuff for me to learn as-well. He was the one who really encouraged me to do a course in IT and see if I was interested in it as a potential career. With his inspiration and guidance, I did a cert IV in IT networking.  </p>
										<p>15 years later I have and still work in IT with no small thanks to him. I started as basic helpdesk in a Big pond call centre and as of last week I am now a Senior Systems Administrator and project Coordinator.  I have diverse range of experiences in IT from Level 1 support to procuring, designing, and maintaining the very infrastructure used to support the entire company. I’ve work on an ERP implementation. I have worked and now even lead several digital transformation projects such as Migrating to 365.  I have even helped in a small way on a R&D project that led to our company building a device that goes done 100's of metre of borehole and analyses the pipes coating condition using lasers and cameras and allows the technician and customer to view the data in real time.</p>

										<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>To be honest, I didn’t. I chose OUA based on the suggestion of my manager and some colleagues and the OUA student advisor recommended RMIT. In saying I am glad they did. It only been 2 weeks so far, but I’ve enjoyed my time as a student at RMIT. I think I can learn a lot from the lecturer and the tutors as-well as from other students. It seems to be a very inclusive University with a wide range of tools and services to help someone study. Which is what I needed. I am doing intro to IT to test the waters before committing to a degree.  I never been an academic person as my mum loves to say “He not academic but he is not dumb” and it true to a degree. I am very kinaesthetic and visual learner and most of my previous academic experience has not catered too well for those style of learning. I think RMIT will be different. While I also don’t believe in Fate or destiny it’s great that I just happen to have a tutor who started as System Admin as-well before really studying anything IT related as a university level. </p>

										<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
										<p>While ultimately if I commit to the degree, it be predominately about a means to acknowledge the skills and experience, I’ve accumulated in the past 15 years, I am hoping to learn a lot too. Through all the different things I have done, do or will do in IT, I have discovered passions professionally for data analytics, BI and project management so while I am studying now to try my hand at studying. I am hoping to learn more about those areas to help make the transition into the next stage of my career smoother.  Not sure how much of this course will cover those areas but having seen the outline of this course I am still interested in learning more about ethics, cyber security and AI and even may be inspired to finally dabble in some home IOT projects.  </p>
