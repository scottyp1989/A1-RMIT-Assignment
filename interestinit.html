									<h2>Interests in IT</h2>

										<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
										<p>I have a diverse interest in IT including IOT, Data analytics, BI and project management. In general, I love learning how to solve problems with technology and how to use technology to solve problems. IT is heavily integrated into my life. Example I have a smart device in every room. One thing that really interest me in IT is the possibilities and the innovation that comes with it. If you told many people 20 years ago, what we do today with AI they wouldn&rsquo;t you. AI is starting to up everywhere, from, from self-driving cars to our own personal assistants like Alexa.</p>
										<p>What interests me most about IT at-least in a practical sense is that I love helping people. IT allows me to do not just personally but professionally. I am the default go to IT support for all my friend and family. I have helped mum and her husband business start and grow in way I never would been able to if I wasn&rsquo;t interested in IT.Professionally not only have I helped many end users and stop but I have also help companies on a whole save money, protect their data and be make them more productive. IT doesn&rsquo;t just allow me to help it also allows me to connect with those I help in ways I never would be able to if I didn&rsquo;t have an interest in IT.</p>

										<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
										<p>I love technology since my first video game which would have been something on the Atari. As a hobby my interest in IT start when I was about 12 and my mum brought home our first computer. My brother would use it for hours often appearing so entertained even when he wasn&rsquo;t playing games. It intrigued me. Unfortunately, my brother wasn&rsquo;t too forthcoming regarding how to do anything he was doing on the computer. Therefore. I had to teach myself.</p>
										<p>With every step of learning something new there was then another problem/hurdle to overcome which only fuelled my interested. &nbsp;I still remember the first PC game I brought, &ldquo;Red faction&rdquo;. I remember it because it ultimately took me close to 10 years to play it. It wouldn&rsquo;t work with the family PC. I would after hours of problem solving, learn about minimum hardware requirements and how our PC didn&rsquo;t cut it. This in part eventually lead to not just buying but building my first gaming pc several years by myself. You&rsquo;d think that where the story about my first game ends. However, I still couldn&rsquo;t play that game, by the time I built it, that graphic card driver at the time had a compatibility issue which results in the game not working on my PC. That didn&rsquo;t deter me though many years later I did play it using the CD I originally brought it on, on a PC I had built myself. Since those early days my perspective of IT is that it two sides of the same coin, a problem and a solution and the solution is often worth challenging the problem.</p>

										<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
										<p>Before I had an interest in pursuing IT as a career. I had always wanted to be a lawyer, studying corporate law most likely. What sparked my interest in IT at-least professionally was a teacher named Colin in my year 10 equivalent course. He taught our computer class among others and saw my passion and aptitude for IT. He saw how quickly I learnt whatever he taught in computer class so one day he pulled me aside and suggested I do cert 3 or 4 in IT. With his inspiration and guidance, I did a cert IV in IT networking about a year later.</p>
										<p>Over 15 years later I have and still work in IT. I started as basic helpdesk in a call centre and as of last week I am now a Senior Systems Administrator and project Coordinator. I have diverse range of experiences in IT from Level 1 support to procuring, designing, and maintaining the very infrastructure used to support the entire company. I&rsquo;ve work on an ERP implementation. I have worked and now even lead several digital transformation projects such as Migrating to 365. I have even helped in a small way on a R&amp;D project that led to our company building a device that goes done 100's of metre of borehole and analyses the pipes coating condition using lasers and cameras and allows the technician and customer to view the data in real time.</p>

										<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t. I chose OUA based on the suggestion of my manager and some colleagues. It was the OUA student advisor who recommended RMIT. It only been 2 weeks so far, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my time as a student at RMIT so far. I think I can learn a lot from the lecturer and the tutors as-well as from other students. It seems to be a very inclusive University with a wide range of tools and services to help someone study. Which is what I needed. I am doing intro to IT to test the waters before committing to a degree. I never been an academic person as my mum loves to say, &ldquo;He not academic but he is not dumb&rdquo; and it true to a degree. I am very kinaesthetic and visual learner and, in my experience so far most of my academic interaction hasn&rsquo;t catered too well to those styles. I think RMIT will be different.</p>


										<hr class="major" />

										<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
										<p>While ultimately if I commit to the degree, it will be predominately about a means to acknowledge the skills and experience Iâ€™ve accumulated in the past 15 years from a job seeking perspective. I am hoping to learn a lot too. Through all the different things I have done, do or will do in IT, I have discovered passions for data analytics, BI and project management so while I am studying now to try my hand at well studying. I am hoping to learn more about those areas to help make the transition into the next stage of my career smoother.  Not sure how much of this course will cover those areas but having seen the outline of this course I am still interested in learning more about ethics, cyber security and AI and even may be inspired to finally dabble in some home IOT projects.</p>
