										<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p><strong>Name of Idea?</strong>&nbsp;Bangforbuck</p>
	<p><strong>What is it?</strong>&nbsp;Price Comparison Tool</p>
	<p>With inflation rising and late-stage capitalism in full effect. Now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. Everything is becoming more expensive, even lettuce has been as high as $10 recently.</p>
	<p>This is where Bang for buck can help. It would be an Australian price comparison tool firstly available as a website to all Australians, for free. It would utilize a combination various data scraping technologies while also collecting data directly from the source by partnering up with Australian retailers to collect details on products such as price, stock, location and descriptions and features of and bring it all to one easy to navigate platform. &nbsp;The idea would be to enable users to not just compare prices and find stock local or online but eventually to even view price history, read reviews and rating by other users. Some of the most exiting future features planned for Bang for buck and what would really set it apart from its competition is it would have an app available on both android and IOS, that app would be able to scan products using QR/Barcode technology to identify the product on the app and find other nearby prices, to ensure the consumer is getting the best deal even when in store. It would also strive to have an AI supported Shopping list to help find you the best deal across specific product such as a brand and model but across the category. For example, the highest rated (or cheapest) carton of lager beer available from a store within 10-minute drive of your home.</p>
	<h4>Motivation</h4>
	<p>My initial motivation for this idea had begun before I even started this course. Why? Because I hate paying full price on well most things, I believe everything these days is overpriced. It not just the price but all this convenience all these options the consumer has in today age has resulted in endless an stream of poor-quality products and with a lack of stricter advertising law, it hard for the average consumer to separate the good from the bad. These days I do what I can to try and save money on my purchases while also ensuring what I purchase is at-least a half decent quality (bang for buck). As a result, I often spend hours researching a product before purchasing. Example, I recently purchased a Samsung 55&rdquo; Q70a considering why buying that over other brands or even paying more for the new version of that model. Once I decided on what I was buying I then spent a fair amount of time looking for the best place to buy it from. Ultimately, I brought it from an online store for about %50 of a RRP as a factory second, saving over $400 from the next cheapest price I had found. Now in that instance would all the time I spent at-least researching where to buy from worth the money I save from not just going to a local store which had it in stock for $400 more? Well, time is money true but it also about principle. &nbsp;Now I understand that in this instance that sounds a lot like a me problem opposed to a general problem, but I doubt I&rsquo;m alone in my beliefs. In-fact I know I&rsquo;m not alone. There is a site called Oz bargain. An Australian forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and services. It gets over a million visitors a month.</p>
	<p>When I initially looked at doing this idea for my assessment project, I had contemplating ditching it. For two reasons</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>In my research on this idea, I found I wasn&rsquo;t alone in this idea. There are at-least a half dozen full functioning sites Australian Price comparison site already that cover the roughly the same retail categories I had envision bang for buck targeting. E.G <a href="https://www.pricehipster.com.au">https://www.pricehipster.com.au</a> , <a href="https://www.getprice.com.au/">https://www.getprice.com.au/</a></li>
	    <li>I wasn&rsquo;t even alone in this very course for this very idea. Another student in Class D had a similar idea. Her idea however restricted to a grocery price comparison tool and would utilize user input to identify the prices and stock levels of products opposed to data scrapers and working with the retailers.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>However, after initially discovering the competitor being discouraged, I ended up spending a little bit of time using it and looking at how they function and what their models are and how they collect their data. When hearing about the other student doing a similar idea and how they were going to tackle their idea, I reflected upon that as-well and that when I had some inspiration. I reformed my idea and believed I have some up with a model and features that make it original and innovative compared to the current and future competitors. Not only that once I decided to go forward with my revision I found myself more motivated than before to try and get as far with this idea as I can, I believe the competition products show there is a demand for a simple, accurate and convenient price comparison tool available for Australia consumers.</p>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>Bang for buck would initially be a website only price comparison tool, available to all Australian consumers for free. Utilizing multiple methods including data scraping technology and collecting data directly from partnered Australian Retailers to give Australian consumers data on 1000&rsquo;s of Products, including Price, Stock, Location, Details. The idea would be eventually to be partnered with all Major Australian retailer both online and brick and mortar type retailers and providing one simple to use platform for users. We don&rsquo;t just want to provide our users with the the cheapest price for what they&rsquo;re looking at the time but also show them the history of the price of the product, so they know if they&rsquo;re truly get a good deal or not. In additional to that we want to other them a platform to get most convenience out of their purchases by giving them an option to find the best price in their area by showing stock levels. Eventually as it user base built up and as it feature list grew it would be hoped that Bang for buck would also be a platform where it&rsquo;s user can find the best products for their budgets as-well with rating and review of products on that platform by other users as-well as linking and partnering with external rating sites giving our users the best bang for their buck. How would Bang for buck generate revenue if it the site is free? 1) We would utilize ad-revenue encouraging our partnered retailers to advertise using out platform 2) We would then offer cheap subscriptions service to our user base giving them the option to pay a small free to upgrade their account to avoid seeing AD firstly and secondly giving them access to special coupon codes we&rsquo;d periodically arrange with our partnered retailers to get a discount at their stores/sites. 3) We would collect revenue by selling analytics and data of our platform back to retailers we&rsquo;ve partnered up with. We would be completely transparent with our user base on this process so they can make informed decisions. Reality is to enable these partnerships with these retailers we&rsquo;re going to have to show them the platform has value to them by enabling them a sales channel and by selling data back to them we give them that value, while also enabling our users the Australian consumers a platform to make truly informed purchasing decisions, while also making ourselves at-least enough revenue to continually grow and improve the platform to further drive value to our users and partners. &nbsp;What would be the features of Bang for buck?</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Easy to view price comparison list, no making it hard to see a list of all users to try and promote one partner over another</li>
	    <li>Where applicable a list of Quantity of product available for a product at a local store (e.g does your closest Kmart have that cheap fan you want to buy)</li>
	    <li>Price History, this wouldn&rsquo;t be available at first but we would record all prices on our platform and make it available to all users</li>
	    <li>Price Alert, users would be able to specific price alerts on specific products</li>
	    <li>Customized Home view as a subscribed user they would have a home page when logged in we would allow them to pick product categories (specific or broad, i.e electronics or Butter) and feed that home page with the best details out platform has found that may be relevant to that</li>
	    <li>Our Platform will have a forum, this will allow users to discuss a range of topics one and other. We will run surveys and what not in those forums to work with our retailers to push for sales on specific products etc to drive great value to our users</li>
	    <li>It won&rsquo;t stay a website we will eventually roll out an APP on both android and IOS with the goal of it eventually having additional capabilities utilizing QR/OCR technologies so that in store our users can scan and item and compare the price of the product in store with the price of the same product elsewhere and hopefully even the price of similar products elsewhere</li>
	    <li>A Shopping List/assistant function. Eventually Using AI and Algorithms to assist our users make the best purchasing decision. A user would be able do own shopping list say basic groceries. They would input &ldquo;butter, bread, milk, eggs, coffee, rice, chicken, toilet paper&rdquo;. Based on a criteria of preferences given by the user the system would work out best options for that user and make recommendation that they need to buy A, B, C from say their local Coles, which is 5 minute walk and need to by X, Y,Z from Woolworths. If they wish to spend the at-least save the most amount of money or buy these products from Aldi if they wish to primary save the most amount of time.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As previously stated, other price comparison tools exists. &nbsp;Some with similar features to what listed here. None of them currently offer everything Bang for buck would. Our last two features which would admittedly be later stages are what really currently sets bang for buck apart from the competition. The later shopping list/assistant feature be quiet original and innovative I believe. None of the current competitors also use the exact same function for collecting data, some data scrape, other partner with retailers, not both. Some using different models for income as-well. Get Price get revenue from making it possible for their retailer to launch market campaign on platform which put their product and prices Infront of the user base ahead of their competitors. We would not operate like that; we would always show the best price based on our user criteria.</p>
	<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
	<p>List of tools and technology needed:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Web server, most likely running on a lamp stack, most likely in the cloud via provider like Microsoft azure or Amazon AWS</li>
	    <li>A content management system like wordpress to help design and build the website</li>
	    <li>Database to collect huge amount of data our website will store most likely SQL. For users, for the data we collect from retailers and the web crawler for scrapping data from websites.</li>
	    <li>Web scrapping script/bot designed to quickly scrap data off websites probably programmed in python</li>
	    <li>A tool like Android studio and java to build our android app for the site(alternatively look into utilising PWA progressive web Apps)</li>
	    <li>A tool like Xcode and use swift to build our IOS app (Look into PWA as-well)</li>
	    <li>Communication and collaboration tools like Office 365</li>
	    <li>API tools and technology for potentially integrating with our partner retailers to retrieve the data</li>
	    <li>Text Editor for the code like Atom or notepad ++</li>
	    <li>Front end development, HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
	    <li>Back End. PHP, asp or asp.net, java, ruby on rails, python.</li>
	    <li>Git for development and version history control to enable our team to effectively build the application together.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Outcome</h4>
	<p>Assuming the project success. It would solve the problem by providing a simple and accurate platform for the Australian consumer to make better purchasing decisions and ultimately save money. If it picked up by a large number of users it has the potential to drive changes within Australia retail market and encourage retailers to be more transparent about their products and the costs associated with them potentially leading to more money in Australian pockets.
