										<h4>Overview</h4>
										<p><strong>Name of Idea:</strong> Bangforbuck</p>
										<p><strong>What is it: Price</strong> Comparison Tool</p>
										<p>With inflation rising(Hutchens, 2022), Now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. Everything is becoming more expensive, even lettuce has hit as high as $10+ recently (Marshall, 2022). This is where Bangforbuck can help. It would be an Australian price comparison tool firstly available as a website. It would utilize a combination of data scraping bots while also working directly with retailers we have partnered up with to collect data.  The data we’d aim to collect would include details on products such as price, stock, location, descriptions and bring it all to one easy to navigate platform.  It would enable users to not just compare prices and find stock local or online but eventually to view price history, read reviews and rating by other users and platforms. </p>
										<h4>Motivation</h4>
										<p>The initial motivation for this idea is because these days I do what I can to try and save money on my purchases while also ensuring what I purchase is at-least a half decent quality (bang for my buck). As a result, I often spend hours researching a product before purchasing or hours finding the best price for it. Often, I find myself asking if the time I spent doing that was worth the money I saved? or worth the product I got over the product I would have just picked if I didn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in that. I know I&rsquo;m not alone. There is a site called Oz bargain. An Australian forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and services. It gets over a million visitors a month&nbsp;(Ozbargain, 2022)</p>
										<p>When I looked at doing this idea for my assessment project, I had initially decided against it for two reasons</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>In my research on this idea, I found out there was already several price comparisons tools out there. There is at-least a 2/3 fully functioning that covered roughly the same retail categories I had envisioned bang for buck targeting. Some of them had the same features my initial idea had as-well E.G <a href="https://www.pricehipster.com.au">https://www.pricehipster.com.au</a>, <a href="https://www.getprice.com.au/">https://www.getprice.com.au/</a></li>
										    <li>I wasn&rsquo;t even alone in this very course for a price comparison idea. Another student in Class D had a similar idea. Her idea was about a grocery price comparison tool and would utilize user input to identify the prices and stock levels of products</li>
										</ul>
										<p>However, one night while I was in a shower, I had an epiphany and now I believe I have come up with a model and features that make my idea original and innovative compared to the current and future competitors.</p>
										<h4>Description</h4>
										<p>Bang for buck would start as website only price comparison tool, available to anyone who registered an account. Collecting data via data scrapping retail websites and by partnering directly with Australian retailers, it would collect data on 1000&rsquo;s of products available in Australia including information on price, stock location and product details. The aim would not just to be provide the users with the current cheapest price on a product but also show the history price of the product. In addition, we want to offer them the convenience of finding product close to them for the best price by including stock levels of the products.</p>
										<p>Bang for buck revenue would work as follow</p>
										<ol>
										    <li>Utilize ads encouraging our partnered retailers to advertise using out platform</li>
										    <li>Offer cheap subscriptions service to our user base giving them the option to pay a small free to upgrade their account to avoid seeing ads firstly and secondly giving them access to special coupon codes with our partnered retailer to get a discount on their products.</li>
										    <li>We would collect revenue by selling analytics and data of our platform back to retailers we&rsquo;ve partnered up with.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Bang for Buck would endeavour to be completely transparent with our user base on our revenue models so they can make informed decisions. To enable these partnerships with retailers we&rsquo;re going to have to create value of the platform to them by giving them access to another sales channel and by giving access to data that can be used in their marketing/advertising. Bang for Buck also requires revenue to continually grow and improve as a platform to further drive value to our users and partners.</p>
										<p>What would be the features of Bang for buck?</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Easy to view price comparison list.</li>
										    <li>Quantity of product available where applicable qty at closest stores</li>
										    <li>Price History, we would record all prices on our platform and make it available to all users</li>
										    <li>Price Alert on specific products</li>
										    <li>Customized Home page views showing most relevant products and prices to the user</li>
										    <li>Rating and Reviews by both Users and external sites</li>
										    <li>A forum. We will leverage it to run surveys to work with our partners to generate exclusive sale events and discounts coupons.</li>
										    <li>An Android and IOS apps for the platform. The apps would utilize QR/OCR technologies so that in store (or online) our users can scan an item and compare the price of the product in store with the price of the same product elsewhere and hopefully even the price of similar products elsewhere</li>
										    <li>A Shopping List/assistant function. Eventually adapting AI and Algorithms to assist our users make the best and most efficient purchasing decisions for themselves. Example: Based on a criterion of preferences given by the user the system would work out best options for that user and make recommendation that they need to buy A, B, C from say their local Coles, which is 5-minute walk and need to by X, Y, Z from Woolworths which is a 5 minute drive, if their goal is to spend at-least amount of money possible despite additional time or say buy all these products from Aldi if they wish to save money while also saving save the most amount of time.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Other price comparison websites exist. Our features however and our model are what make bang for buck truly unique and separate it from the competition. The later shopping list/assistant feature is especially original and innovative I believe.</p>
										<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
										<p>List of tools and technology needed</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Web server, most likely running on a lamp stack, most likely in the cloud via provider like Microsoft azure or Amazon AWS</li>
										    <li>CDN such as Cloudfare or akami for reduced latency, improved availability, security, and intelligence (Akami, 2022)</li>
										    <li>Database to collect huge amount of data our website will store most likely SQL. For users, for the data we collect from retailers and the web crawler for scrapping data from websites.</li>
										    <li>Web scrapping script/bot designed to quickly scrap data off websites probably programmed in python</li>
										    <li>A tool like Android studio and java to build our android app for the site (Google, 2021)</li>
										    <li>A tool like Xcode and use swift to build our IOS app (DevMountain, 2022)</li>
										    <li>Communication and collaboration tools like Office 365</li>
										    <li>API tools and technology for potentially integrating with our partner retailers to retrieve the data</li>
										    <li>Text Editor for the code like Atom or notepad ++</li>
										    <li>Front end development, HTML, CSS, Javascript (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
										    <li>Back End. PHP, asp or asp.net, java, ruby on rails, python. (GeeksforGeeks, 2022)</li>
										    <li>Git for development and version history control to enable our team to effectively build the applications together.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Skills Required</h4>
										<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of skills needed to create Bang for Buck.</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Business development skills to build relationship with the retailer partners</li>
										    <li>Marketing skills to promote the website and app</li>
										    <li>Team skills often overlook but incredibly important to the success of a project</li>
										    <li>Front End development skills to help code the site</li>
										    <li>Back-end development skills to help build the foundation and functionality of the site</li>
										    <li>Project management skills to help drive the project forward and turn it from an idea to reality</li>
										    <li>android development skills if we&rsquo;re to design a native android app for our web application</li>
										    <li>IOS development skills if we&rsquo;re to design an IOS android app for our web application</li>
										    <li>Database Administrator skills to help maintain and build our database</li>
										    <li>Cloud implementation skills to develop</li>
										    <li>AI Skills to create the AI shopping list</li>
										</ul>
										<p>I already possess to various levels several of the skills required including team skills, project management, database administration and cloud implementation. My current studies will also expose me to other skills such as the foundations of AI, machine learning and algorithms will at-least give me a greater understanding what&rsquo;s required to implement a particular innovative feature of Bang for buck. &nbsp;</p>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
										<p>It would solve the problem by providing a simple and accurate platform for the Australian consumer to make better purchasing decisions and ultimately save money. If it is picked up by many users, it has the potential to drive changes within Australia retail market and encourage retailers to be more transparent about their products and the costs associated with them potentially leading to higher quality products and more money in Australian pockets. If the “final version” of Bang for buck was completed including the Mobile Apps and the AI powered Shopping list/assistant functionality it would provide Australian consumer a new way of identifying the best bang for buck products for them</p>
