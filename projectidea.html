										<h4>Overview</h4>
										<p><strong>Name of Idea:</strong> Bangforbuck</p>
										<p><strong>What is it: Price</strong> Comparison Tool</p>
										<p>With inflation rising now more than ever Australian consumers need a convenient way to make better purchasing decisions to ultimately save money. Everything is becoming more expensive, even lettuce has been as high as $10 recently.</p>
										<p>This is where Bang for buck can help. It would be an Australian price comparison tool firstly available as a website to all Australians. It would utilize a combination of data scraping bot/script while also working directly with retailers we have partnered up with to collect data. The data we&rsquo;d aim to collect would include details on products such as price, stock, location and descriptions and features of and bring it all to one easy to navigate platform. The idea would be to enable users to not just compare prices and find stock local or online but eventually to even view price history, read reviews and rating by other users.</p>
										<p>Some of the most exciting future features planned for Bang for buck and what would really set it apart from its competition is it would have an app available on both android and IOS, that app would be able to scan products using QR/OCR technology to identify the product on the app and find other nearby prices, to ensure the consumer is getting the best deal even when in store. It would also strive to have an AI supported Shopping list to help find you the best deal across specific product such as a brand and model but across the category. For example, the highest rated (or cheapest) carton of lager beer available from a store within 10-minute drive of your home.</p>
										<h4>Motivation</h4>
										<p>My initial motivation this idea is because these days I do what I can to try and save money on my purchases while also ensuring what I purchase is at-least a half decent quality (bang for buck). As a result, I often spend hours researching a product before purchasing or hours finding the best price for it. I often find I am asking myself if the time I spent doing that worth the money I saved? Worth the product I got over the product I would have just picked if I didn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in that. I&rsquo;m not alone. There is a site called Oz bargain. An Australian forum/community dedicated to finding and sharing bargains/coupons/sales on all kind of products and services. It gets over a million visitors a month</p>
										<p>When I looked at doing this idea for my assessment project, I had decided against it for two reasons</p>
										<ol>
										    <li>In my research on this idea, I found out there was several price comparisons tools out there. There is at-least a 2/3 fully functioning that covered the roughly the same retail categories I had envisioned bang for buck targeting. Some of them had the same features my initial idea has as-well E.G <a href="https://www.pricehipster.com.au">https://www.pricehipster.com.au</a>, <a href="https://www.getprice.com.au/">https://www.getprice.com.au/</a></li>
										    <li>I wasn&rsquo;t even alone in this very course for a price comparison idea. Another student in Class D had a similar idea. Her idea was about a grocery price comparison tool and would utilize user input to identify the prices and stock levels of products</li>
										</ol>
										<p>However, I spent some time reflecting on the idea and I also ended up spending a little bit of time using some of those sites. Looking at how they function and what their revenue models are and how they collect their data. I ended up having some inspiration and I reformed my idea and believe I have come up with a model and features that make it original and innovative compared to the current and future competitors. I believe the existing competition show there is a demand for a simple, accurate and convenient price comparison tool available for Australia consumers and I believe bangforbuck could be it.</p>
										<h4>Description</h4>
										<p>Bang for buck would start as website only price comparison tool, available to anyone who registered an account. Collecting data via data scrapping retail website and by partnering directly with Australia retailers, bang for buck would collect data on 1000&rsquo;s of products available in Australia including information on price, stock location and product details. The aim would not just to be provide the users with the current cheapest price on a product but also show the history price of the product. In addition, we want to offer them the convenience of finding product close to them for the best price by including stock levels of the products.</p>
										<p>Bang for buck revenue would work as follow</p>
										<ol>
										    <li>Utilize ads encouraging our partnered retailers to advertise using out platform</li>
										    <li>Offer cheap subscriptions service to our user base giving them the option to pay a small free to upgrade their account to avoid seeing AD firstly and secondly giving them access to special coupon codes with our partnered retailer to get a discount on their products.</li>
										    <li>We would collect revenue by selling analytics and data of our platform back to retailers we&rsquo;ve partnered up with.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Bang for Buck would endeavour to be completely transparent with our user base on our revenue models so they can make informed decisions. To enable these partnerships with retailers we&rsquo;re going to have to create value of the platform to them by giving them access to another sales channel and by giving access to data they can be used in their marketing/advertising. Bang for Buck also requires revenue to continually grow and improve as a platform to further drive value to our users and partners.</p>
										<p>What would be the features of Bang for buck?</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Easy to view price comparison list.</li>
										    <li>Where applicable a list of Quantity of product available for a product at a local store (e.g does your closest Kmart have that cheap fan you want to buy)</li>
										    <li>Price History, this wouldn&rsquo;t be available at first, but we would record all prices on our platform and make it available to all users</li>
										    <li>Price Alert, users would be able to specific price alerts on specific products</li>
										    <li>Customized Home view as a subscribed user they would have a home page when logged in we would allow them to pick product categories (specific or broad, i.e electronics or Butter) and feed that home page with the best details out platform has found that may be relevant to that</li>
										    <li>a feature of enabling users to find the best product for their users&rsquo; criteria and budget by including rating and reviews of the product on the platform by other users, as-well as linking and partnering with external rating sites truly giving our users the best bang for buck.</li>
										    <li>Our Platform will have a forum, this will allow users to discuss a range of topics one and other. We will run surveys and what not in those forums to work with our retailers to push for sales on specific products etc to drive great value to our users</li>
										    <li>Create Andriod and IOS apps for the platform. The apps will eventually utilize QR/OCR technologies so that in store (or online) our users can scan and item and compare the price of the product in store with the price of the same product elsewhere and hopefully even the price of similar products elsewhere</li>
										    <li>A Shopping List/assistant function. Eventually Using AI and Algorithms to assist our users make the best purchasing decision. A user would be able do own shopping list say basic groceries. They would input &ldquo;butter, bread, milk, eggs, coffee, rice, chicken, toilet paper&rdquo;. Based on a criteria of preferences given by the user the system would work out best options for that user and make recommendation that they need to buy A, B, C from say their local Coles, which is 5 minute walk and need to by X, Y,Z from Woolworths. If they wish to spend the at-least save the most amount of money or buy these products from Aldi if they wish to primary save the most amount of time.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Other price comparison website exists. Our features however and our model are what make bang for buck truly unique and separate it from the competition. The later shopping list/assistant feature is specially originally and innovative I believe.</p>
										<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
										<p>List of tools and technology needed</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Web server, most likely running on a lamp stack, most likely in the cloud via provider like Microsoft azure or Amazon AWS</li>
										    <li>CDN such as cloudfare or akami for reduced latency, improved availability, security and intelligence</li>
										    <li>A content management system like wordpress to help design and build the website</li>
										    <li>Database to collect huge amount of data our website will store most likely SQL. For users, for the data we collect from retailers and the web crawler for scrapping data from websites.</li>
										    <li>Web scrapping script/bot designed to quickly scrap data off websites probably programmed in python</li>
										    <li>A tool like Android studio and java to build our android app for the site</li>
										    <li>A tool like Xcode and use swift to build our IOS app</li>
										    <li>Communication and collaboration tools like Office 365</li>
										    <li>API tools and technology for potentially integrating with our partner retailers to retrieve the data</li>
										    <li>Text Editor for the code like Atom or notepad ++</li>
										    <li>Front end development, HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
										    <li>Back End. PHP, asp or asp.net, java, ruby on rails, python.</li>
										    <li>Git for development and version history control to enable our team to effectively build the application together.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Skills Required</h4>
										<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of skills needed to create Bang for Buck.</p>
										<ul>
										    <li>Business development management skills to build relationship with the retailer partners</li>
										    <li>Marketing skills to promote the website and app</li>
										    <li>Front End development skills to help code the site</li>
										    <li>Back-end development skills to help build the foundation and functionality of the site</li>
										    <li>Project management skills to help drive the project forward and turn it from an idea to reality</li>
										    <li>android development skills if we&rsquo;re to design a native android app for our web application</li>
										    <li>IOS development skills if we&rsquo;re to design an IOS android app for our web application</li>
										    <li>Database Administrator skills to help maintain and build our database</li>
										    <li>Cloud implementation skills to develop</li>
										    <li>AI Skills to create the AI shopping list</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Outcome</h4>
										<p>Assuming the project success. It would solve the problem by providing a simple and accurate platform for the Australian consumer to make better purchasing decisions and ultimately save money. If it picked up by many users, it has the potential to drive changes within Australia retail market and encourage retailers to be more transparent about their products and the costs associated with them potentially leading higher quality products and more money in Australian pockets. If the “final version” of Bang for buck was completed including the Mobile Apps and the AI powered Shopping list/assistant functionality it would provide Australian consumer a new way of identifying the best bang for buck products for them</p>
